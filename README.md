# Thunderhead Filament Extruder

The Thunderhead filament extruder is a  small scale extruder designed by Techfortrade that can be used for recycling PET plastic bottle flake directly into 3D printing filament. A special emphasis throughout the design has been placed on using affordable and easily attainable materials. This repository serves as a host for the documentation and code used with the machine. We are using GrabCAD Workbench for the hardware development and will place snapshots of the CAD files here on Github with each release. Current (though not necessarily stable) files can be accessed on our [GrabCAD partner space](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gcvN9Xsi01SW-lFGhJRj_-4vqndCMFAaoUt_-UQBdidnVn#/space/gc8b8c582LagITdwrMEId6wysTlJX_nukUvWoRwEQ_1f4U).

## Goals
The Thunderhead is designed with the intent of making it possible to recycle plastic from the post consumer waste stream into 3D printing filament on a small scale with minimal start up capital required. This makes the following possible:
- Low cost 3D printing filament anywhere in the world
- Enable local capture of the value contained in waste plastic
- Access to expensive or hard to find items via 3D printing (eg. [Open Flexure Microscope](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope))
- Small scale business opportunities without need for large amounts of capital
- Enable local recycling where it is otherwise not possible





## PET Plastic 
The Thunderhead is designed to extrude Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET or PETE) for the following reasons:

-  Prints  very well on printers such as the Retr3D
-  Easy to find nearly anywhere on the planet
-  Has good physical properties
-  Reasonably safe to work with, especially compared to ABS which often has Brominated Flame Retardants (BFR)

PET is easily identified by the following symbol usually located on the bottom on the bottle:

There are some challenges to working with PET plastic. A few these are described below. Follow the links to get more detailed information on these and other challenges:

* **Crystalization** - PET crystalizes when cooled slowly. To avoid making filament that is brittle like glass, a water bath is used.
* **Low Viscosity** - When PET melts it has a low viscosity and a low melt strength which makes it difficult to pull into a filament with an even diameter. The Thunderhead uses a cooling tube to help increase the viscosity and melt strength before the plastic leaves the extruder. The water bath also helps to 
* **Hygroscopicity** - PET pulls water out of the air and holds on to it. This water can cause problems during extrusion and printing such as air bubbles, foaming and degredation of the plastic.
* **Hydrolysis** - The polymer chains in PET can break down in the presence of water at elevated temperatures. When this happens, the viscosity of the melt is reduced, making it difficult to extrude. To Avoid this problem, the plastic flakes must be thoroughly dried just before extrusion. 



## Safety/Liability

You are responsible for your own safety.



## Building the Thunderhead

Please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/TechforTrade/Thunderhead-Filament-Extruder/wiki) for detailed information on building the Thunderhead. 

#### Major Tools Needed####

Note that you don't necessarily have to own all of these tools. A local shop could do some of the work for you. Especially the lathe and milling work. See the Wiki for a more exhaustive list.

* Drill Press
* Metal Lathe - Threading the barrel and making the shaft for the gear box
* Welding (stick, oxy-acetalene, etc.) - For welding frames together
* 3D printer - Many of the complex parts in the machine are 3D printed
* Milling Machine (optional) - For milling flats into a few parts. Could be done with grinder and hand files though more time consuming.
* Horizontal band saw (optional) - For cutting stock metal to size. A hacksaw and vice will work, but will be slower.


#### Major components of the Thunderhead

<img src="./img/Extruder_Components.jpg" width="800" align="middle">

1. **Control Box** - Contains the power supply, Arduino, and other circuitry needed to operate the extruder. Note: Other components such as the starve feeder and diameter sensors have their own control circuitry.
2. **Starve Feeder**- Used to add flakes to the extruder at a constent rate. The starve feeder has its own controller and communicates with the main microcontroller via IIC. Subcomponents are:
   1. Hopper - Holdes flake ready to be extruded
   2. Vibratory Conveyer - Moves flake to the balance and keeps flake from bridging, and rat holing.
   3. Balance - Weighs out small portions of flake and then delivers them to the extruder at a constant rate. Feedback from the balance controls the vibratory conveyer.
3. **Auger Motor and Gear Box** - A large NEMA 42 stepper motor and 3:1 gear box with 3D printed gears. The stepper alows for speed control and the gearbox increases the torque on the auger.
4. **Barrel** - The barrel has many components. The main components are:
   1. Feed Throat - Location where the plastic enters the barrel. Made with internal grooves to improve the feeding of the plastic into the barrel.
   2. Auger - A 1/2 in. diameter, 18 in. long wood auger used to convey the plastic through the barrel. NOTE: This is not designed for plastics extrusion and performs significantly worse than a plastic extrusion screw would. It is much less expensive though.
   3. Barrel - 1/2in I.D. DOM metal pipe through which the auger pushes the plastic. It has two heating zones that are heated by 104 watt 1/2 in. fiberglass insulated heating tape.
   4. Breaker plate - A small disk of metal with a number of holes drilled into it that acts to reduce the twist in the plastic that is caused by the screw. 
   5. Cooling tube - A brass tube at the end of the barrel that reduces the temperature of the plastic melt in order to increase its viscosity. The bend in the tube helps to aim the filament at the guide roller at the end of the water bath and improve roundness of the filament. It has two heating zones.
   6. Nozzle - determines diameter of melt as it leaves the extruder. Equiped with its own heating zone so that surface quality of the filament can be improved.
5. **Fume Hood** - Used to collect fumes given off by the extruder and channel them into a tube.
6. **Diameter Sensors** - Non contact laser diameter sensors with their own control electronics. The first is used to determine the diameter of the melt as it leaves the extruder and control the speed of the outfeed rollers in order to maintain a constant diameter. The second is used to monitor the final diameter and ensure that the set point of the first diameter sensor is correct. They communicate with the main microcontroller via IIC.
7. **Water Bath** - Used to cool the melt quickly. This is important because otherwise, the PET would neck down to a very small diameter or cool too slowly and crystalize. Crystalized plastic is too brittle to work with a 3D printer.
8. **Outfeed Rollers** - Used to pull the filament through the water bath. Their speed determines the diameter of the filament. The rollers are controlled by the primary diameter sensor.
9. **Spooler** - Winds the filament up onto a spool. The spooler is still being worked on, early designs fought with the outfeed rollers and caused uneven filament diameters. Contains its own control electronics and communicates with the main microcontroller via IIC.




## Software

Please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/TechforTrade/Thunderhead-Filament-Extruder/wiki) for detailed information on the use of the various bits of code kept in this repository.

Five firmware installations must be completed to get the Thunderhead up and running. These are:

- **Thunderware.ino** - for the Arduino mega 2560 that controls the machine (located in the controller box)
- **StarveFeeder.ino** - Upload to the Arduino Nano that controls the starve feeder.
- **Diameter_Sensor.ino (x2)** - Install on <u>both</u> the primary and QC diameter sensor Arduino Nanos.
- **Spooler.ino** - Upload to the Arduino Nano that controls the spooler.

Additionally, there is code written in Processing called **Extruder_Data_visualizer.pde** that produces real time graphs of the the output of the diameter sensors as well as the outfeed roller RPM. This can be useful for tuning the PID in the primary diameter sensor that controls the filament diameter.

## On Going Work

All the present files can be found [here on our GrabCAD Workbench](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gcvN9Xsi01SW-lFGhJRj_-4vqndCMFAaoUt_-UQBdidnVn#/space/gc8b8c582LagITdwrMEId6wysTlJX_nukUvWoRwEQ_1f4U).

## Planned Improvements

### Drying hopper

Currently the plastic is dried and then put into the hopper where it sits and
absorbs moisture. With a drying hopper, the plastic would be continuously dried
and would have no chance to absorb moisture before entering the machine. This
may help improve the melt viscosity by reducing the amount of polymer
hydrolysis.

### Non Contact Diameter Sensor

In order to effectively control the diameter by varying the speed of the outfeed
rollers, the diameter must be measured at or close to the point where changes in
roller speed have the greatest effect on the diameter. This is in a location
where the plastic cannot be touched, just below the nozzle and above the surface
of the water. Using a laser and a CCD array, the diameter could be measured by
taking a picture of the shadow of the plastic melt as it enters the water bath.
The gap between the water bath and the nozzle is only about 10 mm so the sensor
will be partially submerged in water. It will need to be waterproof.

### New Filament support/guiding strategy

The shape and diameter of the filament is essentially set when the hot plastic
enters the water bath. Unwanted movement of the filament down stream from this
point can greatly impact the shape of the filament. New strategies for guiding
the filament in a controlled manner need to be explored. The shape of the
filament is also heavily impacted by the large guide wheel which it contacts
just after it enters the water. Are there other ways to support the filament as
it moves through the water bath that result in more consistent shape?

### Nozzle Geometry and Drawdown

It may be fruitful to explore different nozzle geometries and the amount and
rate of drawdown. What are the optimal conditions for consistent filament?

### Test different sources of PET

Not all PET resins are the same. By testing resins from various bottle sources
and even virgin pellets, it may be possible to determine whether or not some
sources have more desirable characteristics than others.

### Melt Filter

A screen should be added just up stream of the breaker plate. This screen will
catch debris and improve the quality of the filament.

### Explore potential additives

Desiccating agents such as CaO (quicklime) or even Portland cement might
possibly be added to scavenge water remaining in the melt, which would help
improve viscosity. Nucleating agents such as sodium benzoate and talc might be
used to encourage crystal growth, growing more numerous and smaller crystals
which may help to reduce the brittleness of crystalline polymer.
